# WIP-Western-Game--scripts
The scripts from an unfinished wild west video game I had. More of a concept than anything. My goal was to use the mouse wheel to make the player have a more interactive experience with each of the weapons.

I used the Godot game engine, which uses it's own interpretive language of GDScript to write all these pages. I believe it is based on Python, so I have uploaded the scripts as python files.

I wanted the player to use the mouse wheel to add as way to interact with the weapons in the game, as apart form VR, interaction with weapons in videogamesa are extremely limited to simple button presses.

My intention was to have the player feel more immersed in the experience, as they have a high level of control over the weapons, as they are forced to reload and cock the weapons manually in a series of input as opposed to 1 button press for each.
